# Creating components

Each app component shall be defined in a folder with an index.tsx for the main entry point to that component. There shall be a default export for that component.

The folder should be named in Pascal case, e.g. MyComponentName component should be names MyComponentName in the index.tsx file. 

# Creating sub components

The initial assumption should be that a component will not be reused and so will be placed in the folder of parent component.
